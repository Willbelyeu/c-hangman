# Overview

This is a hangman game written on CLion in c++. It has five chances to guess the correct letters.

My purpose in writing this program is to practise using c++ while trying to expand my knowledge of programming languages.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
